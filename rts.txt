khawaja kamal lahori mirzai launches a donation campaign for engleish translation quran.
 
so huge amount of sixteen thousand was given as a donation from the colors at that time. 

but when the english translation was published it was sold at a high price.

this translation is full of superstitions of qadianism.reseiving donations in the name of islam 

and the quran promoted false ideas of mirzaiyat. if sixteen thousand had arrived from rangoon alon,

how much help would the muslims of the whole country and other countries have provided?but all this

was happening in the name of islam.in rangoon, only two or four houses belonged to mirzais.

khawaja sahib corresponded with some people of rangoon and made a program to go to rangoon.

the purpose was two fold.the first objective is the publication of merzite in burma province

the second purpose is donations from muslims. some rangoon merchants promised to donate at least one lakh rupees

fortunately jamiat-ul-ulema was established in rangoon and many madrassas that led to the ulema-e-islam s rangoon 

scholars have posted advertisements to show the true face of mirza and mirzat to warn muslims and paste it all

over the city.from whom muslims became acquainted withrangoon
