        evidence of invalidation of mirza and mirzaiyat and non-islam</h1>

        the lawsuit alleges that after the death of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed,the Mirzais became divided and how many

        sects they still have there has been some brief mention of interfaiteh beliefs in these sects

        since these sects are relatively large and famous are the two sects the first group is lahori whose member is khawaja kamaludden the second group is qadiyani 

        the head of mirza qadiani is mirza mahmood so on this occasion we consider them both to be quite a matter off

        it should be noted that these two sects are always afraid to come to islam they know very well that their base is on the air

        but if they get stuck somewhere,then death and life start debate about christ
        
        and the qadiani sect is sometimes prepared for the fact that prophecy is not over
